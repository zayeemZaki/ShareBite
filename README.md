```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Writing Tests
Tests are located in the `__tests__/` directory. We use Jest for testing.

Example test:
```typescript
import App from '../App';

test('App component exists', () => {
  expect(App).toBeDefined();
  expect(typeof App).toBe('function');
});
```

## 🚀 Building for Production

### Android
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will be generated at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### iOS
1. Open `ios/ShareBite.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select your device or simulator
3. Choose `Product` > `Archive`
4. Follow the App Store submission process

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Metro Server Issues
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Kill process on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9
```

#### Android Build Issues
```bash
# Clean Android build
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Reset project
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

cd ios
rm -rf build
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
```

## Built With

- React Native 0.81.1
- TypeScript
- React 19.1.0

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
